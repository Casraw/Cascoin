# Cascoin Wallet GUI Optimization Configuration
# This file contains recommended settings to prevent GUI freezing

# Mining thread configuration
# Reserve at least 1 CPU core for GUI responsiveness
# Set to -1 to use automatic detection (cores - 1)
# Set to specific number to manually control thread count
hivecheckthreads=-1

# Hive mining optimizations
# Enable early abort when new blocks arrive (recommended: true)
hiveearlyout=true

# Reduce hive check delay for more responsive mining (milliseconds)
# Default: 1000, Lower values = more responsive but higher CPU usage
hivecheckdelay=1000

# GUI update frequency (affects responsiveness vs CPU usage)
# These are compile-time constants, but can be overridden in future versions

# Additional performance settings
# Disable unnecessary features if experiencing performance issues
# server=0          # Disable RPC server if not needed
# listen=0          # Disable listening for connections if running as client only
# maxconnections=8  # Limit connections to reduce network overhead

# Memory optimizations
# dbcache=100       # Reduce database cache if low on memory
# maxmempool=50     # Reduce mempool size if needed

# Logging (disable in production for better performance)
# debug=0           # Disable debug logging
# printtoconsole=0  # Disable console output

# Example optimal settings for different scenarios:

# HIGH-PERFORMANCE MINING (may impact GUI responsiveness)
# hivecheckthreads=0    # Use all cores
# hiveearlyout=false    # Don't abort early
# hivecheckdelay=500    # Faster checking

# BALANCED PERFORMANCE (recommended for most users)
# hivecheckthreads=-1   # Auto-detect (cores - 1)
# hiveearlyout=true     # Enable early abort
# hivecheckdelay=1000   # Standard delay

# GUI-PRIORITY MODE (for users who prioritize interface responsiveness)
# hivecheckthreads=1    # Minimal mining threads
# hiveearlyout=true     # Enable early abort
# hivecheckdelay=2000   # Slower checking

# To use this configuration:
# 1. Copy this file to your Cascoin data directory
# 2. Rename to cascoin.conf
# 3. Restart the wallet
# 4. Monitor performance and adjust as needed
