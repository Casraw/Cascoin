Cascoin: Rialto: End-to-end encrypted chat.

Rialto chat uses the exact same type of secp256k keypairs that we trust to protect our
coins, and is implemented using only cryptographic primitives which already exist in
the Cascoin codebase.

Our implementation encapsulates a message in three envelopes:

    Layer 1: Plaintext message, recipient and sender nicks, and timestamp, all signed by
             sender's private key.

    Layer 2: Layer 1 Envelope, encrypted with an ECIES hybrid scheme system using 
             AES-256-CBC encryption, SHA512 KDF, and HMAC-SHA256 MAC.

    Layer 3: Layer 2 Envelope, encapsulated with a Proof-of-Work nonce and timestamp.

For information on ECIES in general, see:

    https://wiki.bitmessage.org/index.php/Encryption
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Encryption_Scheme
    https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/32671/1/V2-I2-P7-13.pdf

It is impossible to tell from messages in flight who either the sender or recipient are.
A recipient must try each of their Rialto private keys to generate the ECDH shared secret
and check if the resulting MAC is valid in order to decrypt the Layer 1 envelope.

Only once the signature in the Layer 1 envelope is verified can the sender be determined,
and the message considered trusted.

Replication of the timestamp in the Layer 1 and Layer 3 envelopes protects against a replay
attack whereby an observer repackages a Layer 2 envelope with a new nonce and timestamp,
and sends it to the recipient.

Inclusion of the recipient nick in the Layer 1 envelope prevents a malicious user in receipt
of a valid message from reusing the signature and repacking the message to send to a different
recipient while appearing to be the original sender.

All messaging is off-chain and is facilitated by the P2P network only.

Privacy is prioritised over convenience in every design decision. This is a feature, not a bug.
However, this means that online/offline status is not available until your chat partner sends
you a message.

The use of ECDH in ECIES provides partial forward secrecy. Even if the sender's private key is
compromised, and an adversary has captured encrypted messages previously sent by the sender,
the messages cannot be decrypted. However, in the event that the recipient's private key is
compromised, captured messages sent to the recipient can be decrypted.

A White Pages system, populated by on-chain "Nick Creation Transactions", maps nicknames to
compressed pubkeys for use in generating ECDH shared secrets.

The Proof-of-Work component in the Layer 3 envelope uses our CPU-bound Minotaur hash algorithm.
It should only take a second to calculate on most hardware, and in conjunction with the cost
to register a nick in the White Pages, and the ability for users to maintain local blocklists,
aims to mitigate spam. Minotaur, rather than the more expensive MinotaurX, is used to ensure
that validating Layer 3 Envelopes is not a significant burden on nodes.

Rialto messaging benefits from the robust CAS P2P network and are propogated through the
network in the same way as blocks and transactions. A node advertises a hash of a Rialto
message that is has received or originated, and its connected peers request the message data
(Layer 3 Envelope) from the node. The P2P component of Rialto messaging uses the existing
inventory / getdata flow for efficient message propogation across the network. 

Upon receipt of a Rialto message, if the Layer 3 Envelope is valid, the message is in turn
advertised to connected peers. In addition, message decryption is attempted with all local
Rialto private keys. The enrypted message is propagated to peers even on successful decryption,
to prevent malicious connected peers deducing the recipient of a message.

Support for relaying Rialto messages is enabled by default, but can be optionally disabled.
Rialto messages are not propagated to peers that are not advertising support for Rialto
messaging, and nick creation transactions remain valid transactions even for un-upgraded nodes.

In this way, upgraded nodes can continue to peer with un-upgraded nodes and agree on network
consensus.

Rialto White Pages; light extension of CDBWrapper.

Registered nicknames are mapped to compressed pubkeys (33 bytes: Sign byte 0x02 or 0x03, and 256 bit x coord. See BIP137.)

Three White Pages instances are created:
    - Global White Pages containing all nick/pubkey pairs,
    - Local White Pages containing only nick/pubkey pairs for which the local wallet has private keys.
    - Blocklist containing nicks blocked by this node.
