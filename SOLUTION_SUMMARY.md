# GUI Freezing Solution for Cascoin Wallet

## Problem Analysis

The Cascoin wallet GUI was freezing when CPU load reached 100% due to:

1. **Blocking operations on main thread**: Wallet operations like `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain()` and `LOCK2(cs_main, wallet->cs_wallet)` were running synchronously on the GUI thread
2. **CPU-intensive mining**: Hive mining operations were consuming all available CPU cores without reserving resources for GUI responsiveness  
3. **Frequent polling**: Model updates every 250ms with potential lock contention
4. **No adaptive behavior**: System didn't adjust behavior based on load conditions

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Background Threading for Wallet Operations

**Files Modified:**
- `src/qt/walletmodel.cpp`: Moved blocking wallet operations to background threads
- `src/qt/walletview.cpp`: Moved wallet rescan to background thread with progress dialog

**Key Changes:**
- Wallet balance polling now runs in background threads using `std::thread`
- Progress dialogs with `QCoreApplication::processEvents()` to keep GUI responsive
- Used `QMetaObject::invokeMethod()` to safely update UI from background threads
- Added `TRY_LOCK` with immediate return to prevent indefinite blocking

### 2. CPU Management and Thread Prioritization

**New Files:**
- `src/qt/cpumanager.h/cpp`: Utility class for CPU and thread management
- `src/qt/cpusettingsdialog.h/cpp`: User interface for CPU configuration

**Key Features:**
- Automatic thread priority reduction for mining operations
- Reserved CPU cores for GUI responsiveness (default: reserve 1 core)
- Cross-platform thread priority management (Windows/Unix)
- User-configurable mining thread limits

**Mining Thread Improvements:**
- `src/miner.cpp`: Updated `CheckBin()` and `CheckBinMinotaur()` functions
- Set mining threads to below-normal priority using `CPUManager::SetThreadPriority(1)`
- Increased yield frequency from every 1000 iterations to every 500
- Added `CPUManager::YieldToGUI()` calls for better responsiveness

### 3. GUI Responsiveness Monitoring

**New Files:**
- `src/qt/responsemonitor.h/cpp`: Real-time GUI responsiveness monitoring
- `src/qt/adaptivepoller.h/cpp`: Adaptive polling that adjusts to system load

**Features:**
- Monitors GUI thread response times every 500ms
- Detects high load when response time > 100ms
- Automatically reduces polling frequency by 3x under high load
- Emits signals when load conditions change

### 4. Improved Update Frequency

**Files Modified:**
- `src/qt/guiconstants.h`: Increased `MODEL_UPDATE_DELAY` from 250ms to 500ms
- `src/qt/walletmodel.cpp`: Implemented background threading for balance updates

### 5. Build System Integration

**Files Modified:**
- `src/Makefile.qt.include`: Added all new source files and headers
- Proper MOC file generation for Qt classes

## Technical Details

### Thread Safety Measures
- Used `std::atomic<bool>` flags for thread-safe communication
- Proper mutex usage with `TRY_LOCK` to avoid deadlocks
- Qt's signal-slot mechanism for thread-safe UI updates

### Performance Optimizations
- Reserved CPU cores for GUI (configurable via `-hivecheckthreads` argument)
- Dynamic thread priority adjustment based on system load
- Adaptive polling that reduces frequency under high load
- Background processing for expensive wallet operations

### User Experience Improvements
- Progress dialogs for long-running operations
- Real-time feedback during wallet operations
- Configurable CPU usage settings
- Automatic adaptation to system conditions

## Configuration Options

### Command Line Arguments
- `-hivecheckthreads=N`: Set number of mining threads (default: cores-1)
- Existing Hive arguments remain compatible

### Runtime Settings
- CPU Settings dialog accessible from main menu
- Real-time adjustment of thread priorities
- Adaptive polling enable/disable

## Expected Results

1. **GUI Remains Responsive**: Even at 100% CPU load, the GUI should remain interactive
2. **Smooth User Experience**: Progress dialogs and background processing prevent freezing
3. **Configurable Performance**: Users can balance mining performance vs GUI responsiveness
4. **Adaptive Behavior**: System automatically adjusts to changing load conditions
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Testing Recommendations

1. **High CPU Load Test**: Start intensive mining and verify GUI remains responsive
2. **Wallet Operations Test**: Create transactions, rescan wallet while mining
3. **Long-running Operations**: Test wallet sync and other blocking operations
4. **Configuration Test**: Verify CPU settings dialog works correctly
5. **Stress Test**: Run wallet for extended periods under various load conditions
